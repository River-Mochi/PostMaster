## Magic Mail

- Control post offices, post-vans, sorting facilities, and post-trucks.
- Also provides some auto 'magic' fixes for the mail system.


### How to Use

- **Quick Start Button**  1-Click to apply all recommended settings.
    - not sure what to do? Just use this button, done - play with a better working mail system.

### Power Users

- Adjust post-van mail load, fleet size, and post-truck fleet size.
- Boost speed and storage capacity for sorting facilities.
- Simple city-wide mail statistics and recent activity in the Status tab.
- All sliders and toggles are optional and can be reset to game defaults (vanilla).

### Fixes for mail issues

1. **auto Fix** low amount of local mail by magically topping up mail when storage drops below a certain amount (you can choose).
2. **auto Fix** mail overflow by trimming overfilled mail buffers so they do not remain blocked forever (for PO and Sorters).
3. **auto Fix** low amount of unsorted mail at sorting facilities to keep the sorting active. 
Currently, cargo shipyards could be shipping out most of the unsorted mail leaving very little for local sorting (reference below).
4. Fixes are workaround solutions until CO fixes the mail transfer process.

- Does not use Harmony or Reflection, less likely to break with game updates.
