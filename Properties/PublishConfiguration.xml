## Magic Mail [MM]

- MPM gives more control over post offices, sorting facilities, and post-vans.
- It also provides a some "magic" fixes for issues with the mail system (until CO/IF fixes it).

### Features

- **Fix low Local mail** at post offices by "magically" topping up Local Mail when storage
  drops below a configurable threshold.
- **Fix low Unsorted mail** at sorting facilities to keep sorting lines active.
- **Fix mail overflow** by trimming overfilled mail buffers at post offices and sorting
  facilities so they do not remain blocked forever.
- Adjust **post van mail load**, **post van fleet size**, and **post truck fleet size**.
- Boost **sorting speed** and **sorting storage capacity** for sorting facilities.
- Show simple city-wide mail statistics and recent activity in the options UI.

All sliders and toggles are optional and can be reset to game defaults (vanilla) or to a recommended quick-start
preset.

### 4 Languages

- Français French, Deutsch German, Español Spanish,
- 简体中文 (Simplified Chinese)


### Compatibility
- Safe to remove at any time; postal facilities will fall back to the
  game's default.

### Credits

- River-Mochi: author and maintainer.
- Inspired by Infixo's "Postal Helper".
